My first scrapy spider made by following https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html
It scrapes quotes.toscrape.com and gives the Quote, the author, and tags of the quote.

How to run:

1. Change your directory to the Spiders directory
	cd /.../Spiders

2. Run "scrapy crawl quotes"
